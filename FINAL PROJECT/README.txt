Prompt: Why is tkinter not clearing the current window after clicking a button?

Based on the response we created a clear_window function to be called to clear the tkinter window
def clear_window():
    for widget in root.winfo_children():
        widget.destroy()


5. The following source was used for user text entry via Tkinter

6. The following was used for creating a message box in tkinter
https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.messagebox.html

- Used messagebox.showerror() to notify user when they made an error such as missing values:
tkinter.messagebox.showerror(title=None, message=None, **options)
Creates and displays an error message box with the specified title and message.

- Used messagebox.showinfo() to notify user when task has been completed:
tkinter.messagebox.showinfo(title=None, message=None, **options)
Creates and displays an information message box with the specified title and message.

The following was used to debug an error in the get_account_type function
Prompt: Why am I being directed striaght to the organizer login and not showing option buttons?
    #Ask User if they are an attendee or an organizer
    tk.Label(root, text = "Select Account Type:").pack()

    # Create attendee button
    # if clicked, will navigate to attendee login
    tk.Button(root, text = "Attendee", command = login("Attendee")).pack()

    # Create Organizer Button
    # If clicked, will navigate to organizer login
    tk.Button(root, text = "Organizer", command = login("Organizer")).pack()

Response:
command = login("Attendee")
â€¦it calls the function right away and assigns the result (usually None) as the command.

To fix it, use a lambda to defer the call:
tk.Label(root, text="Select Account Type:").pack()

    # Use lambda to pass parameters correctly
    tk.Button(root, text="Attendee", command=lambda: login("Attendee")).pack()
    tk.Button(root, text="Organizer", command=lambda: login("Organizer")).pack()
